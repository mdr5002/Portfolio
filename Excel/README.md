## Data

The Spreadsheet titled **Customer Ageing Report** was set up for ageing and invoice payment analysis. It uses an extensive variety of formulas, macros, and formatting, including XLookup, IF statements, Filter, Match, and a macro to prepare an email with attachments directly from the worksheet!

The **Retail Sales by DOW** (Day of Week) excel sheet uses the current date as the catalyst for this speadsheet to be self maintaining. Each day a new row becomes visible and new totals are calculated using conditional formatting, IF statements, SumIf's and Xlookups!

The attached **Upwork Video** is a promotional video I put together which goes through the various capabilities of the Customer Ageing Report to showcase and explain it's function.
