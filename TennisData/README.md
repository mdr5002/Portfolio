## Dependencies

This notebook relies on the following Python libraries and packages:

- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- numpy
- geopandas
- bokeh
- scikit-learn

## Data

The dataset used in this analysis consists of tennis match data from 1987-2023. It includes information such as tournament details, player rankings, match statistics, and more. The data has been obtained from Kaggle and combined for analysis.

## Analysis

In this notebook, we conducted various analyses on the tennis match data, including:

- Data loading and cleaning.
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution of player ages and rankings.
- Visualization of the number of wins by country using geospatial data.
- Visualization of the relationship between winner age and rank.
- Analysis of aces and double faults by surface type.
- Machine learning model to predict match outcomes based on player rankings and other features.

## Conclusion

This notebook has explored tennis match data, revealing interesting insights into player performance, surface types, and match outcomes. The machine learning model achieved a high accuracy in predicting match results based on player rankings.

Future work could involve further feature engineering and exploring additional machine learning algorithms to improve predictive accuracy.
