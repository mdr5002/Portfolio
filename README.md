# Mike Rice's Data Portfolio

## Introduction

Hello! I'm Mike, with a career mostily in accounting and finance I am using this portfolio to showcase some of my additional formula creation, reporting, and technical skills focused on data analysis, visualization, and automation. I have been exploring various methods and languages and am constantly excited to learn new material to expand my technological skillset.

## Contents

- **Excel Projects**: Various data analysis and visualization projects done in Excel.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Data analytics projects executed in Jupyter notebooks.
- **SQL Projects**: SQL queries and database designs showcased in Markdown files with code snippets and tables.
- **Python Scripts**: Automation and data manipulation scripts written in Python.

## Navigating the Repository

Each project or script is stored in its own directory. A brief description of each project can be found in its corresponding README file.
